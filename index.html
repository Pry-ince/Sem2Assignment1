                    <p>
                        They don't know how old I am<br>
                        They found armour in my belly<br>
                        From the sixteenth century<br>
                        Conquistador, I think<br>
                        They don't know how old I am<br>
                        They found armour in my belly<br>
                        Passion out of machine revving tension<br>
                        Lashing out at machine revving tension<br>
                        Brushing by the machine revving tension
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Morning broke out the back side of a truck stop<br>
                        End of a line, a real rainbow likening luck stop<br>
                        Where you could say I became chronologically fucked up<br>
                        Put ten bucks in just to get the tank topped off
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then I found a place, it's dark and it's rotted<br>
                        It's a cool, sweet kind of place where the copters won't spot it<br>
                        And I destroyed the map, I even thought I forgot it<br>
                        However, every day I'm dumping the body
                    </p>

                        It'd be better for me if you don't understand

                        And I destroyed the map that I carefully dotted<br>
                        However, every day I'm dumping the body
